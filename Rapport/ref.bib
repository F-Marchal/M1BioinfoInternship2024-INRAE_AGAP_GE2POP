	abstract = {We produced a unique large dataset of reference transcriptomes to obtain new knowledge about the evolution of plant genomes and crop domestication. For this purpose we validated a RNA-Seq data assembly protocol to perform comparative population genomics. For the validation, we assessed and compared the quality of de novo Illumina short-read assemblies using data from two crops for which an annotated reference genome was available, namely grapevine and sorghum. We used the same protocol for the release of 26 new transcriptomes of crop plants and wild relatives, including still understudied crops such as yam, pearl millet and fonio. The species list has a wide taxonomic representation with the inclusion of 15 monocots and 11 eudicots. All contigs were annotated using BLAST, prot4EST, and Blast2GO. A strong originality of the dataset is that each crop is associated with close relative species, which will permit whole genome comparative evolutionary studies between crops and their wild related species. This large resource will thus serve research communities working on both crops and model organisms. All the data are available at http://arcadbioinformatics.southgreen.fr/.},

	title = {{GeCKO}: user-friendly workflows for genotyping complex genomes using target enrichment capture. {A} use case on the large tetraploid durum wheat genome.},
	shorttitle = {{GeCKO}},
	abstract = {Background:
Genotyping of individuals plays a pivotal role in various biological analyses, with technology choice influenced by multiple factors including genomic constraints, number of targeted loci and individuals, cost considerations, and the ease of sample preparation and data processing. Target enrichment capture of specific polymorphic regions has emerged as a flexible and cost-effective genomic reduction method for genotyping, especially adapted to the case of very large genomes. However, this approach necessitates complex bioinformatics treatment to extract genotyping data from raw reads. Existing workflows predominantly cater to phylogenetic inference, leaving a gap in user-friendly tools for genotyping analysis based on capture methods. In response to these challenges, we have developed GeCKO (Genotyping Complexity Knocked-Out). To assess the effectiveness of combining target enrichment capture with GeCKO, we conducted a case study on durum wheat domestication history, involving sequencing, processing, and analyzing variants in four relevant durum wheat groups.
Results:
GeCKO encompasses four distinct workflows, each designed for specific steps of genomic data processing: (i) read demultiplexing and trimming for data cleaning, (ii) read mapping to align sequences to a reference genome, (iii) variant calling to identify genetic variants, and (iv) variant filtering. Each workflow in GeCKO can be easily configured and is executable across diverse computational environments. The workflows generate comprehensive HTML reports including key summary statistics and illustrative graphs, ensuring traceable, reproducible results and facilitating straightforward quality assessment. A specific innovation within GeCKO is its 'targeted remapping' feature, specifically designed for efficient treatment of targeted enrichment capture data. This process consists of extracting reads mapped to the targeted regions, constructing a smaller sub-reference genome, and remapping the reads to this sub-reference, thereby enhancing the efficiency of subsequent steps.
Conclusions:
The case study results showed the expected intra-group diversity and inter-group differentiation levels, confirming the method's effectiveness for genotyping and analyzing genetic diversity in species with complex genomes. GeCKO streamlined the data processing, significantly improving computational performance and efficiency. The targeted remapping enabled straightforward SNP calling in durum wheat, a task otherwise complicated by the species' large genome size. This illustrates its potential applications in various biological research contexts.},

Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (dN and dS) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use.

Here, we provide a step-by-step protocol to illustrate the commonly used tests available in the program, including the branch models, the site models, and the branch-site models, which can be used to detect positive selection driving adaptive protein evolution affecting particular lineages of the species phylogeny, affecting a subset of amino acid residues in the protein, and affecting a subset of sites along prespecified lineages, respectively. A data set of the myxovirus (Mx) genes from ten mammal and two bird species is used as an example.

However, this result has been questioned, and a robust phylogeny of wheat relatives is still lacking. Using transcriptome data from all diploid species and a new methodological approach, our comprehensive phylogenomic analysis revealed that more than half of the species descend from an ancient hybridization event but with a more complex scenario involving a different parent than previously thought—Aegilops mutica, an overlooked wild species—instead of the B genome. We also detected other extensive gene flow events that could explain long-standing controversies in the classification of wheat relatives.},

	abstract = {How and why genetic diversity varies among species is a long-standing question in evolutionary biology. Life history traits have been shown to explain a large part of observed diversity. Among them, mating systems have one of the strongest impacts on genetic diversity, with selfing species usually exhibiting much lower diversity than outcrossing relatives. Theory predicts that a high rate of selfing amplifies selection at linked sites, reducing genetic diversity genome-wide, but frequent bottlenecks and rapid population turn-over could also explain low genetic diversity in selfers. However, how linked selection varies with mating systems and whether it is sufficient to explain the observed difference between selfers and outcrossers has never been tested. Here, we used the Aegilops/Triticum grass species, a group characterized by contrasted mating systems (from obligate outcrossing to high selfing) and marked recombination rate variation across the genome, to quantify the effects of mating system and linked selection on patterns of neutral and selected polymorphism. By analyzing phenotypic and transcriptomic data of 13 species, we show that selfing strongly affects genetic diversity and the efficacy of selection by amplifying the intensity of linked selection genome-wide. In particular, signatures of adaptation were only found in the highly recombining regions in outcrossing species. These results bear implications for the evolution of mating systems and, more generally, for our understanding of the fundamental drivers of genetic diversity.Aegilops/Triticum grass species are the wild relatives of cultivated wheat. A main difference among these species is their mating system. Some species need to cross-fertilize to reproduce (outcrossing); some species mostly reproduce by auto-fertilization (selfing), while others reproduce by a mixture of outcrossing and selfing (mixed mating). The mating system has a strong impact on the genetic diversity, with selfing species usually exhibiting much lower diversity than outcrossing relatives. However, the reasons for this are not fully clear. Here, we show that selfing strongly reduces the diversity across the entire genome mainly because genome-wide linkage disequilibrium amplifies the effect of selection either against deleterious mutations or in favor of beneficial ones. Only outcrossing species showed genomic signatures of recurrent adaptation, suggesting that self-fertilization may have a long-term impact on species ability to evolve and adapt.},

	abstract = {Comparison of relative fixation rates of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) mutations provides a means for understanding the mechanisms of molecular sequence evolution. The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (ω = dN/dS) is an important indicator of selective pressure at the protein level, with ω = 1 meaning neutral mutations, ω \&lt; 1 purifying selection, and ω \&gt; 1 diversifying positive selection. Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different underlying ω ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous ω ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear, mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions of ω among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure indicated by the ω ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected in several genes in which the average ω ratio across sites is \&lt;1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection with ω \&gt; 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the β-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1 env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to the specific distributional form assumed for ω and can be achieved using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of ω among sites from real data sets.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large (\&gt;80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of \&gt;50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80–90\% success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.Availability and implementation: STAR is implemented as a standalone C++ code. STAR is free open source software distributed under GPLv3 license and can be downloaded from http://code.google.com/p/rna-star/.Contact:  dobin@cshl.edu.},

It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date.

	abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.\&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

This article introduces SeqKit2, the next iteration of the widely used sequence analysis tool SeqKit, featuring expanded functionality, performance optimizations, and support for additional compression methods. Retaining a pragmatic subcommand architecture, SeqKit2 represents substantial enhancement through the inclusion of 19 additional subcommands, expanding its overall repertoire to a total of 38 in eight categories. The new subcommands add functionality such as amplicon processing and robust, error-tolerant parsing of sequence records. In addition, three subcommands designed for real-time analysis are added for periodic monitoring of properties of FASTQ and Binary Alignment/Map alignment records and real-time streaming from multiple sequence files. The performance of SeqKit2 is benchmarked against the old version of SeqKit, Bioawk, Seqtk, and SeqFu tools. SeqKit2 consistently outperforms its predecessor, albeit with marginally higher memory usage, while maintaining competitive runtimes against other tools. With its broad functionality, proven usability, and ongoing development driven by user feedback, we hope that bioinformaticians will find SeqKit2 useful as a “Swiss army knife” of sequence and alignment processing—equally adept at facilitating ad hoc analyses and seamlessly integrating into larger pipelines.},
